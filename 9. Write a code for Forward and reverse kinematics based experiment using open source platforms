Performing forward and inverse kinematics experiments using the open-source robotics platform, ROS (Robot Operating System). This example assumes that you have already set up a ROS environment and have a robotic arm model with forward and inverse kinematics implemented.

1. Forward Kinematics Experiment:

import rospy
from sensor_msgs.msg import JointState
from geometry_msgs.msg import PoseStamped

# Define the joint angles for the robotic arm
joint_angles = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

def forward_kinematics(joint_angles):
    # Create a new pose stamped message
    pose = PoseStamped()

    # Set the header information
    pose.header.frame_id = "base_link"
    pose.header.stamp = rospy.Time.now()

    # Set the position and orientation using forward kinematics
    # for your specific robotic arm model
    # ...

    # Publish the pose message to a topic for visualization or further processing
    pub.publish(pose)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        # Initialize the ROS node
        rospy.init_node('forward_kinematics')

        # Create a publisher for the pose topic
        pub = rospy.Publisher('arm_pose', PoseStamped, queue_size=10)

        # Loop through different joint angles and compute forward kinematics
        for i in range(10):
            joint_angles[0] = i * 0.1
            forward_kinematics(joint_angles)

        # Spin the ROS node to keep it running
        rospy.spin()

    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass


This code sets up a ROS node and a publisher for the arm_pose topic, which will publish the computed pose of the robotic arm based on different joint angles. In the main loop, we loop through different joint angles and call the forward_kinematics function to compute the pose using the specific forward kinematics equations for your robotic arm model. The computed pose is then published to the arm_pose topic for visualization or further processing.

2. Inverse Kinematics Experiment:

import rospy
from sensor_msgs.msg import JointState
from geometry_msgs.msg import PoseStamped
from moveit_msgs.msg import RobotState, Constraints, PositionConstraint
from moveit_msgs.srv import GetPositionIK, GetPositionIKRequest

# Define the pose for the robotic arm
pose = PoseStamped()
pose.header.frame_id = "base_link"
pose.pose.position.x = 0.5
pose.pose.position.y = 0.5
pose.pose.position.z = 0.5
pose.pose.orientation.x = 0.0
pose.pose.orientation.y = 0.0
pose.pose.orientation.z = 0.0
pose.pose.orientation.w = 1.0

def inverse_kinematics(pose):
    # Create a new IK request message
    ik_request = GetPositionIKRequest()

    # Set the robot state for the request message
    robot_state = RobotState()
    robot_state.joint_state.name = ["joint1", "joint2", "joint3", "joint4", "joint5", "joint6"]
    robot_state.joint_state.position = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ik_request.robot_state = robot_state

    # Set the constraints for the IK request message
    position_constraint = PositionConstraint()
    position_constraint.header.frame_id = "base_link"
    position_constraint.link_name = "end_effector_link"
    position_constraint.target_point_offset.x = 0.0
    position_constraint.target_point_offset.y = 0.0
    position_constraint.target_point_offset.z = 0.0
    position_constraint
