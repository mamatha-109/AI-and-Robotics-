L293D Motor Driver Module
NodeMCU or "ESP8266"
PIR motion sensor HC-sr501
Jumper wires
The 433MHz OR the 315MHz module (both work the same way) Tx and Rx pair 
Push button switches X 5 (Again not needed if you're using a computer to control the bot).
The Rx part of theTx/Rx pair
100uF Electrolytic Caps X 4.
L293D motor driver chip X 2 (Each chip controls 2 motors bi-directionally...So if you want to make a 2 wheeled bot you will require only 1 L293D chip).
0.1uF ceramic caps X 12 (3 for each motor)....for eliminating noise between the controller and motors.
